<p><b>The Compiler Projects</b></p>
<p>The goals of this project is to design a simple but Turing Computable 
programming language and to implement a compiler for the language. For project 1, the compiler 
will scan, parse and report if the program is legal or not. </p>
 
<p><b>Policies:</b> <br>This project will use the C programming language. 
It will be a recursive descent parser. 
</p>
<p>Your compiler should take input of the source code from a file.</p>
 
<p>At a minimum, you must implement the following language features: </p>
 
<ul>
  <li> A main method</li>
	<li>Variable declarations (with a policy: do all declarations come first 
or can they be intermingled with executable statements)</li>
	<li>An iterator</li>
	<li>A selector</li>
	<li>An assignment statement</li>
	<li>Evaluation of nested arithmetic expressions</li>
	<li>A general solution with regard to comparison operators</li>
	<li>Provision of an integer data type</li>
	<li>Provision for numeric constants</li>
	<li>A syntactic element to place comments in the code</li>
   
</ul>&nbsp;
Project 1 will require a symbol table.  
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">A word about identifiers:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">A legal <tt>&lt;identifier&gt;</tt> 
will start with a letter followed by combinations of letters, numbers, and 
underscores, subject to the following two rules:</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">1. You cannot have consecutive 
underscores</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px;">2. An identifier cannot end with 
an underscore. </p>
<p>These are valid identifiers: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<tt>&nbsp; e123, e, qwert5yuio, a_b_7</tt></p>
<p>These are not:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e__7, abc_&nbsp; </p>
<p>You are certainly invited but not required to extend the basic capabilities 
of your compiler. Here are some examples of what you might add: </p>
 
<ul>
	<li>Additional data types such as float, char, etc</li>
	<li>Subprograms</li>
	<li>An indexing mechanism to handle arrays.</li>
	<li>Pointers and dynamic allocation (we are allowed to make some assumptions 
	regarding memory management)</li>
</ul>
  <b>Input and Output<br>
</b>There will be no user interaction with the program. The program
will be invoked 8 times from a shell script as demonstrated in class
(see below in deliverables). Input will be via commandline parameter of
the file to be parsed, specified in the script file. Output will be to
the console reporting either a successful parse or a syntax error and
the line on which the error was detected.<b><br>
<br>
Other Policies</b> <br>
 All projects will be individual.<p><b>Deliverables:</b><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</span></p>
<p>You will submit all your work bundled up in WinZip (on PC) to the DropBox
 for the course on <tt>elearning.uwf.edu. </tt>Please
make your name is very
clear on the zipfile you upload and inside all files contained within
the zipfile. Place all your files in a single directory named <span style="font-family: monospace;">&lt;firstInitial&gt;&lt;lastname&gt;-p&lt;projNumber&gt;.</span> For instance, my&nbsp; submission would be<span style="font-family: monospace;"> jcoffey-p1. </span>zip that folder into a .zip file and upload it to the appropriate dropbox. <br>
</p>
<p>So, submit a single zip file containing a single folder, with the following items in the folder:<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
 
</p>
<ul>
   <li>The grammar for your language</li>
   <li>Source code for the lexical analyzer and parser portion of your program</li>
   <li>Design documents for this part of the project</li>
  <li>A User's manual regarding exactly what this submission does and how to 
	run it</li>

	<li>Four examples each of both <span style="font-style: italic;">legal</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">illegal</span> programs. The programs 
	should be of increasing complexity, with the last demonstrating all features 
	of your language.</li>
	<li>A
script that compiles all legal and illegal programs as a batch,
providing an indication that the compile was a success or appropriate
error messages.</li>
   <li>A <span style="font-family: monospace;">makefile</span> to build your project<br>
</li>
 
</ul>
